			<h1>Hi there! My name is Mrab Ezreb</h1>
			<h2>One day, I was looking for a way to make money, so I thought, hey, I like making websites</h2>
			<h2>So I decided to make money by making websites!</h2>
			<h2>And so, you too can have a website, all for a small fee.</h2>
			<h2>For the low low price of (see below for pricing), I can build you a website!</h2>
			<h2>And once I do, I can even help you with hosting the website!</h2>
			<h2>So how about it, I build your website and help you put it on the internet. Sounds good to me!</h2>
			<h2>So lets go!</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="pricing">
			<p>Now, how much will this cost me?</p>
			<p>First off, the cost to build the website starts at $5. That gets you 5 pages.</p>
			<p>Then, each extra page is 50&cent;</p>
			<p>However, that is just for me to create the website. You probably also want your website to be on the internet, right?</p>
			<p>I will host your application on a website called heroku. In fact, the way that I build websites is designed for heroku.</p>
			<p>Because heroku can be complicated to non-programmers, I can handle everything for you!</p>
			<p>Plus, you probably want a url (like pizzapies.net) instead of an ip address (like 123.456.78.910). Godaddy is a leader in domain name registration, and I will handle that as well!</p>
			<p>All that I ask is $9/month to keep the server and domain running, as well as providing support if the website doesn't work as intended.</p>
			<p>I will even add more stuff to your website if you want!</p>
			<p>(Note: If you have your own server, I can give you the files that you need for $25)</p> 
		</div>
		<div class="contact">
			<p>So how do I get my website?</p>
			<p>Firstly, I accept payments through paypal, and paypal accepts many forms of payment.</p>
			<p>But before you do anything, email me at ezrebsites@@outlook.com and we can discuss <b>all the things</b>!</p>
